# Security for Users

This page is a user-facing summary of the security properties of the OIDC
Agent Compatibility Server. For the full technical threat model, see
[Threat Model](../reference/threat-model.md). For a consolidated, ordered
set of deployment checks, see the
[Production Hardening Checklist](./production-checklist.md).

## Provider keys never touch your laptop

Provider API keys (e.g. an OpenAI API key) are encrypted at rest in the
central database and decrypted **only** in the central proxy's process
memory. They are:

- Never sent to any laptop.
- Never logged.
- Never in a config file or admin API response.
- Never in an error response.

The relay holds only a **central-minted opaque token** — a 256-bit random
value (`oac_` prefix) that is SHA-256 hashed at rest in central's database and
verified by the central proxy on every request. The relay is a dumb forwarder;
it does not verify tokens locally.

## OIDC authentication

You authenticate via the standard OIDC authorization-code + PKCE flow
against your enterprise IdP (Okta, Keycloak, etc.):

- **PKCE S256** (RFC 7636/9700) — prevents authorization code
  interception.
- **Loopback redirect** (RFC 8252) — the IdP redirects to
  `http://127.0.0.1:<random-port>/callback`, which only your local relay
  can receive.
- **ID token validation** — the relay verifies the ID token signature
  (alg pinned to RS256 or ES256), issuer, audience, expiry, nonce, and
  `at_hash`.
- **Token lifetime** — central-minted tokens have a lifetime set by the
  `--ttl` flag on `oac-relay login` (e.g. `--ttl 1d`, `--ttl 1y`). Default:
  never expires. An admin can set `max_token_ttl_seconds` on group policies as
  a backstop that rejects tokens older than the limit at request time.

## mTLS between relay and central

All relay-to-central traffic is mutually authenticated with TLS 1.3 and a
company CA:

- The relay presents a client cert to the central proxy.
- The central proxy presents a server cert to the relay.
- Both are verified against the company CA.
- Private key files must have `0600` permissions.

> **⚠️ Production:** Use your **company PKI** to issue mTLS certificates.
> The `./docker/generate-certs.sh` script creates self-signed test certs
> (CN=`OAC Test CA`) — these are for dev/testing only and must not be used
> in a production deployment that handles real API keys.

## Token security

- **256-bit tokens** generated from the OS CSPRNG (`OsRng`) at central.
- **SHA-256 hashed at rest** — only the hash is stored in central's database,
  never the plaintext.
- **Constant-time comparison** — token verification uses
  `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` with no early return (prevents timing attacks,
  CWE-208).
- **`0600` file permissions** — the agent config file (containing the
  plaintext token) is readable only by you.
- **`Zeroizing` memory** — plaintext tokens are held in `Zeroizing` wrappers
  that zero memory on drop.

## DNS rebinding defense

The relay validates the `Host` header on every request. Only loopback
hosts (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `[::1]`) are accepted. This prevents DNS
rebinding attacks where a malicious website could trick your browser into
sending requests to your local relay.

## Hop-by-hop header stripping

The relay and central proxy strip hop-by-hop headers (RFC 7230 §6.1) on
both requests and responses. This prevents connection-level header leakage
across proxy hops.

## Audit trail

Every request is logged in an **append-only** audit log:

- **Relay activity log** — records method, endpoint, model, central status,
  latency, request ID.
- **Central audit log** — records user subject, identity, email, groups,
  model, backend, endpoint, status, latency, stream flag, token usage,
  cost, permission decision, denial reason, request ID.

Both logs are enforced append-only at the database level (SQLite triggers
abort any UPDATE or DELETE).

## Group-based authorization

The central proxy enforces per-group policies:

- **Model allowlists** — restrict which models each group can use.
- **Endpoint restrictions** — restrict which API endpoints each group can
  access.
- **Daily quotas** — per-user daily token and request limits.

Policies are resolved by merging all policies for the user's groups, with
**most-permissive-wins** semantics.

## No `unsafe` code

All crates have `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. There is no `unsafe` code
anywhere in the project.

## Secret redaction in logs

All logs are structured JSON with a secret-redaction layer. Sensitive
fields (`authorization`, `api_key`, `client_secret`, `token`,
`master_key`, etc.) are automatically replaced with `[REDACTED]`.

## What you should do

- **Keep your laptop secure** — the central token in your agent config is
  only as safe as your laptop. Use disk encryption and screen lock.
- **Log out when done** — run `oac-relay logout` to revoke your token at
  central (`DELETE /v1/tokens/current`).
- **Don't share your agent config file** — `~/.codex/config.json` or
  `~/.oac/agent-env.sh` contains your central token.
- **Report suspicious activity** — check the audit log via the admin API
  if you suspect unauthorized use.
