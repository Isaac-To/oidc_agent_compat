# Relay Setup

The laptop relay (`oac-relay`) is a thin binary that each employee runs on
their machine. It authenticates the employee via OIDC, requests a central-minted token,
injects it into the agent's config, and forwards agent traffic over mTLS to
the central proxy.

> The relay is a **dumb forwarder**. It holds only a central-minted token
> (256-bit, stored in the agent config file) and an mTLS client certificate.
> The relay does not verify tokens — central is the sole verification
> authority.

## Configuration

Create a config file for the relay. Start from the production reference
config and edit it for your environment:

```sh
cp docker/prod/configs/relay.toml ~/.oac/relay.toml
```

The relay config uses flat top-level fields (no `[relay]` wrapper). A
minimal production config:

```toml
listen_addr = "127.0.0.1:8787"
database_url = "sqlite://~/.oac/relay.db"
dev_mode = false

[oidc]
issuer = "https://idp.example.com"
client_id = "oac-relay"
client_secret_env = "OAC_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET"
redirect_uri = "http://127.0.0.1:0/callback"
scopes = ["openid", "email", "profile", "groups"]

[central]
url = "https://central.example.com:8443"
ca_cert_path = "/etc/oac/ca.crt"
client_cert_path = "/etc/oac/client.crt"
client_key_path = "/etc/oac/client.key"
```

Key points:

- `listen_addr` **must** be loopback (`127.0.0.1`) in production. The
  config validator rejects `0.0.0.0` unless `dev_mode = true`.
- `client_secret_env` is the **name of an environment variable** holding
  the OIDC client secret — never the secret itself.
- `redirect_uri` uses port `0` (any port); the relay binds a random
  loopback port at login time per RFC 8252.
- `scopes` should include `groups` if you want group-based authorization
  enforced by the central proxy.
- `central.url` must be `https://` in production (mTLS enforced).
- Cert paths (`ca_cert_path`, `client_cert_path`, `client_key_path`) must
  be absolute — `~` is **not** expanded (only `sqlite://` database URLs
  expand `~`).

See [Configuration Reference](./configuration.md) for all fields.

Set the OIDC client secret environment variable:

```sh
export OAC_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="your-oidc-client-secret"
```

## Lifecycle

### `oac-relay login` — authenticate and configure the agent

```sh
oac-relay --config ~/.oac/relay.toml login
```

This runs the full OIDC authorization-code + PKCE flow:

1. Validates the loopback redirect URI (RFC 8252).
2. Performs OIDC discovery against the IdP.
3. Binds a random loopback port and opens the system browser to the IdP
   login page.
4. After the employee logs in, the IdP redirects back to the loopback
   callback with an authorization code.
5. The relay exchanges the code (with PKCE verifier) for tokens.
6. Validates the ID token: alg pinned to {RS256, ES256}, verifies iss,
   aud, exp, nonce, signature, and `at_hash`.
7. Fetches userinfo (or falls back to ID-token claims).
8. Upserts the user identity in the local SQLite DB.
9. Requests a central-minted token via `POST /v1/tokens` (stores only the
   SHA-256 hash at central; plaintext returned to the relay).
10. Injects the base URL + token into the agent config file.

The agent config is written to one of:

| Agent | File | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Codex | `~/.codex/config.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/config.json`) | JSON: `{"api_base_url": "...", "api_key": "..."}` |
| Generic | `~/.oac/agent-env.sh` | Shell: `export OPENAI_API_BASE='...'` / `export OPENAI_API_KEY='...'` |

The Codex config is used only if `CODEX_HOME` is set or
`~/.codex/config.json` already exists; otherwise the generic env file is
written. The file is created with `0600` permissions.

On success, the relay prints:

```
oac-relay: login successful for alice@example.com (agent config written to /home/alice/.oac/agent-env.sh)
```

### `oac-relay serve` — start the relay server

```sh
oac-relay --config ~/.oac/relay.toml serve
```

- Opens the SQLite DB (runs migrations, enforces `0600` perms).
- If `dev_mode = true`, skips auth checks (central rejects unauthenticated
  requests via its token store).
- Binds `TcpListener` to `listen_addr`.
- Serves the HTTP router with graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM).

### `oac-relay logout` — revoke the current central token

```sh
oac-relay --config ~/.oac/relay.toml logout
```

Calls `DELETE /v1/tokens/current` at central to revoke the token. The agent
config file is **not** deleted — the token stays in the file but stops
working; run `login` again to mint a fresh token.

### `oac-relay print-key` — re-print the token

```sh
oac-relay print-key
```

Reads the agent config file (not the DB) and prints the base URL and token.
Useful if you need to copy the token into a tool that doesn't read the
auto-injected config.

### `oac-relay list-keys` — list all tokens

```sh
oac-relay --config ~/.oac/relay.toml list-keys
```

Calls `GET /v1/tokens` at central. Lists all tokens for the current user:
id, label, created_at, expires_at, last_used_at.

## How the agent connects

After `login`, the agent is configured to point at:

- **Base URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1`
- **Token:** the central-minted token (e.g. `oac_abc123...`)

The agent sends standard OpenAI-compatible requests. The relay:

1. Validates the `Host` header (DNS rebinding defense — loopback only).
2. Checks for a non-empty `Authorization: Bearer ***` header (pass-through —
   does not verify the token locally).
3. Adds `x-oac-request-id` (per-request correlation UUID).
4. Forwards over mTLS to the central proxy (with the Authorization header
   unchanged — central verifies the token via its TokenStore).
5. Streams the response back (including SSE).

## Dev mode

When `dev_mode = true`:

- The relay can bind `0.0.0.0` (needed for Docker).
- The central URL can be `http://` (no mTLS).
- The relay skips auth checks (central rejects unauthenticated requests).

Dev mode is for testing only. **Never use it in production.**
