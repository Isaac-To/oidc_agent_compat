# Request Data Flow

This page walks through the full request lifecycle, showing what headers
are added, stripped, and transformed at each hop.

```

## Step 1: Agent → Relay

The agent sends a standard OpenAI-compatible request:

```http
POST /v1/chat/completions HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8787
Authorization: Bearer oac_abc123...
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: */*
User-Agent: codex/1.0

{"model":"gpt-4","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}
```

### Relay processing

1. **Host guard** (`host_guard_middleware`):
   - Validates `Host` header is loopback (`127.0.0.1:8787`,
     `localhost:8787`, `[::1]:8787`).
   - Mismatch → `400 Bad Request` (DNS rebinding defense).

2. **Auth** (`auth_middleware`):
   - Extracts `Authorization: Bearer ***` header.
   - Checks for a non-empty bearer (presence check only — the relay is a
     dumb forwarder and does NOT verify the token). Central verifies it
     via its TokenStore.
   - Missing → `401 Unauthorized` (non-dev mode).
   - On success: inserts a minimal `VerifiedIdentity` (all fields `None`)
     into request extensions for the activity logger.

3. **Forward** (`proxy_handler` → `forward_request`):
   - Generates `request_id = Uuid::new_v4()`.
   - Reads body (max 10 MB).
   - Extracts `model` from body (for activity logging).
   - Sanitizes path (`sanitize_path` — rejects `..`, `//`, `\`, absolute
     URLs).
   - Builds upstream URL: `{config.central.url}{sanitized_path}`.
   - Builds forward headers (`build_forward_headers` — allowlist model,
     strips hop-by-hop headers but **forwards the `Authorization` header
     unchanged** — central verifies the token).
   - Adds `x-oac-request-id` (per-request correlation UUID v4).
   - Sends over mTLS (production) or plain HTTP (dev).

4. **Activity log** (best-effort, after response):
   - Records `RelayActivityEntry` (identity_id, key_id, method, endpoint,
     model, central_status, latency_ms, request_id).

## Step 2: Relay → Central (over mTLS)

```http
POST /v1/chat/completions HTTP/1.1
Host: central:8443
Authorization: Bearer oac_...
x-oac-request-id: 660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: */*
User-Agent: codex/1.0

{"model":"gpt-4","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}
```

> Note: The `Authorization` header (the agent's bearer token) is forwarded
> unchanged. Hop-by-hop headers are stripped. The relay does not inject
> identity headers — central extracts identity from the token record.

### Central processing

1. **Auth** (`auth_middleware`):
   - Skips `/healthz`.
   - Extracts the bearer token from the `Authorization` header.
   - Verifies it via `TokenStore::verify_token()` (DB lookup,
     constant-time hash comparison, no early return — prevents timing
     leaks, CWE-208). Expired tokens are deleted.
   - Missing/unverifiable → `401 Unauthorized` (unless `dev_mode`, which
     allows through with a warning).
   - `X-OAC-*` identity headers are **ignored** — identity comes from the
     token record.
   - Inserts `VerifiedRelayIdentity` (with `token_id` and `created_at` for
     backstop enforcement) into extensions.

2. **Rate limit** (`rate_limit_middleware`, production only):
   - Per-IP token bucket (60 req/min default).
   - Exceeded → `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After`.
   - Runs **before** permission checks, so policy-denied requests still
     consume a rate-limit token.

3. **Permissions** (`permissions_middleware`):
   - Skip `/healthz`.
   - Parse groups from the token record's `groups` field (JSON array).
   - `PolicyStore::resolve_policy(&groups)` — most-permissive-wins merge.
   - **Token-TTL backstop check** — if `max_token_ttl_seconds` is set and
     the token is older than the limit (from `created_at`), the token row
     is deleted and the request is rejected with `401`.
   - **Device revocation check** — if `DeviceStore::is_revoked` → `403`
     (`"device_revoked"`).
   - **Endpoint check** — `policy.is_endpoint_allowed(&endpoint)` →
     `403` (`"endpoint_not_allowed"`).
   - **Model check** (POST) — extract model, check
     `policy.is_model_allowed` → `403` (`"model_not_allowed"`).
   - **Quota checks** (both pre-flight): **token quota** — if
     `daily_token_quota` set and `usage.token_count >= quota` → `429`
     (`"token_quota_exceeded"`); **request quota** — an atomic
     `try_reserve_request` reservation → `429` (`"quota_exceeded"`)
     when it cannot be taken (released again if the upstream request
     fails).
   - On allow: inserts `PermissionDecision` into extensions.
   - If the resolved policy has the token saver enabled, attaches a
     `TokenSaverGrant` (config) to the extensions for the forward handler.

4. **Forward** (`proxy_handler` → `forward_request`):
   - Reads body (max 10 MB).
   - Extracts model.
   - **Token saver** (if a `TokenSaverGrant` is present): applies the safe
     optimizer to the body — removes exact-verbatim duplicate messages and
     structurally-empty messages, drops empty `tools: []`, and, if a budget
     is set, drops the oldest whole turns (never truncates) to fit. If the
     policy enabled `collapse_repeated_lines`, consecutive exact-verbatim
     repeated lines inside a single message are folded into `[×N]` markers
     (RTK-adapted). If the policy enabled `strip_ansi`, terminal ANSI
     colour/control codes are removed from message content. Kept messages are
     otherwise never rewritten, and a final "never-worse" guard reverts to
     the original body if the optimizer would ever increase token usage.
     Records `OptimizationReport`.
   - Sanitizes path.
  - Builds upstream URL: `{provider.base_url}{sanitized_path}`.
   - Builds forward headers (strips hop-by-hop headers).
   - **Replaces** `Authorization` with the selected provider key (held in
     `Zeroizing<String>` memory).
   - Sends to backend.

## Step 3: Central → Backend (over HTTPS)

```http
POST /v1/chat/completions HTTP/1.1
Host: api.openai.com
Authorization: Bearer sk-<provider-key>
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: */*
User-Agent: codex/1.0

{"model":"gpt-4","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}
```

> Note: Identity headers are gone. `Authorization` is now the selected
> provider key; provider keys are never returned to the relay.

## Step 4: Response (Backend → Central → Relay → Agent)

### Non-streaming response

The central proxy:

1. Buffers the response body.
2. Extracts token usage from the `usage` JSON field.
3. Computes cost via `PriceTable::compute_cost`.
4. Records `AuditEntry` (best-effort).
5. Increments usage counters (best-effort, allowed requests only).
6. Strips hop-by-hop + `content-length` headers.
7. Returns the response.

The relay:

1. Strips hop-by-hop + `content-length` headers.
2. Returns the response to the agent.
3. Records `RelayActivityEntry` (best-effort).

### SSE streaming response

When `Content-Type: text/event-stream`:

- **Central**: sets `stream_options.include_usage=true`, then streams via
  `bytes_stream()` → `Body::from_stream` while wrapping with
  `wrap_stream_with_usage_extraction` to intercept `data:` lines and
  extract `usage` from the final chunk (before `data: [DONE]`). Audit and
  usage accounting are deferred until the stream completes; the forwarded
  SSE bytes are not modified.

## MCP request flow

MCP traffic rides a parallel path with per-tool enforcement:

1. The agent POSTs JSON-RPC to `http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp/{server}`
   (single server) or `/mcp` (combined hub).
2. The relay checks for the `Authorization` header (same pass-through
   as `/v1`), best-effort parses `mcp_server`/`mcp_tool`/`mcp_method` for
   its activity log, and byte-tunnels the body (with the `Authorization`
   header) to central.
   **Batches (JSON-RPC arrays) are rejected** — a batch could smuggle
   `tools/call` requests past per-tool enforcement.
3. Central verifies the bearer token via TokenStore, then:
   - **Per-server endpoint**: `mcp_permissions_middleware` classifies the
     method (`tools/call` vs other), resolves the caller's
     per-group/per-server/per-tool allowlist, and denies with `403`
     (`-32001`) outside it; non-`tools/call` methods require at least one
     allowed tool on that server. Callers with no groups are denied all.
   - **Hub**: the handler splits the `server__tool` prefix, enforces the
     same policy inline, fans `tools/list` out to enabled servers the
     policy can reach, and answers `ping` locally.
4. Central injects the server's encrypted `auth_header` (decrypted into
   `Zeroizing` memory), strips hop-by-hop headers, forwards the bytes,
   and passes SSE responses through unchanged.
5. Every request — allowed or denied — produces an audit entry with
   `mcp_server`, `mcp_tool`, `mcp_method`, the permission decision, and a
   redacted, 512-char-capped args preview; the relay records the same
   metadata in its activity log.

See [MCP Support](../user-guide/mcp.md) for the user-facing behavior and
error codes.
- **Relay**: streams via `bytes_stream()` → `Body::from_stream` (raw
  byte passthrough).
